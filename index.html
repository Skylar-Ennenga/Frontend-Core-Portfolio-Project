        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Skylar, and I am currently in the midst of a career transition into the world of coding. 
            I enjoy playing games, learning new things, and spending time with my family. I come from years of deployable communication experience with an emphasis on network engineering. 
            I have always loved coding and recently had the opportunity to pursue the future I want.
            This journey starts with Coding Temple and continues as I search for coding jobs where I can further grow and harness my skills. 
            My goal is to make coding a full-time career and define my future as a full-stack developer.</p>
